summary: Applications of soccer throughout my life.
---

Said by Ronaldinho, "For me soccer provides so many emotions, a different feeling every day." 

I resonate with this saying so much. Everyday I feel like things I've learnt from soccer applications to my daily life. Because of this sport I feel that I was able to come out of a bubble teaching me how to enjoy life and becoming generally more loose. Everything about the "Beautiful Game", the players, the passion, my teammates helped me in a low point in my life. Playing soccer was my way to get my mind off of the "real world" and a way for me to let loose. Because of this sport I was able to create life-long friendships, teamwork bonding, and creating a healthy competitive spirit.
