## Overview
The Manoa Music application is a website which allows UH Students and community members alike to find others with musical talents/interests. Using Javascript, Meteor, Uniforms, and Semantic UI as a group we developed a website that executes this idea. With features such as creating a profile, being able to view other profiles, and creating Jam Sessions to schedule meetings up with other musicians.     

## Contributions
I mainly worked on the list profiles page for user and admin with functionality for editing and deletion for the admin side. I also worked on Jam Sessions and Profile Page for each profile.

## What I Learned
This project taught me development skills with the new technologies we learned and used. However, I think the most important skill I learned throughout this project and got better at was time management. During this project I realized how important communication is for time management. From the beginning of being tasked with a group till the last day to turn in our project we had communicated everyday. Setting meeting times, discussing new ideas, and solving tasks together. I felt that with my group we had always been on top of time management and that's why we were able to be on task to finish this project efficiently.
