summary: Final project for ICS 111
---

This project was our final project for ICS 111. 

Bossfight is a boss battle simulation taking inspiration from the "bullet hell", roguelike RPG game, Realm of the mad God. The objective of the game is to defeat the boss without having your life go to zero. The player controls the avatar using the WASD key for 360 degree movement while using a mouse to damage the boss with projectiles.

For this project, I learned many things for game development such as game/sound design, phases, movement, sprites, stage generation, etc. I really also enjoyed the little details in this project such as when you defeat the boss a chest spawns prompting to a audio of people cheering to a win screen.
