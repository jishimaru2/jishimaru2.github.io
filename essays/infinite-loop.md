I have reached the “Summit Point”, accomplished all my goals and achieved my lifelong dreams. Is hopefully what I would like to be saying in a few years time. However, life usually hits you with the saying “one step forwards takes you two steps back”. I am starting to understand this saying as I start my path towards a professional career. Life is a long journey where you will experience many hiccups, highs and lows, and is quite literally is a never ending cycle, some may say an infinite loop. This continual loop of just getting one task done just to be hit with another can be very draining. 
```
while(true){
}

Everyday before going to sleep I wonder where I will be in the next 5, 10, even 15 years. I feel that I am in at my most creative state after dawn. I don’t know what it is, the sun slowly fading away into the horizon, the lights of the city glaring, the peace and quiet nature gets the right-side of my brain going. And software engineering is a part of that. I think to myself what avenue I would most be interested in having a job that I would be happy going into, not just a recurring 9 to 5. Some that come to mind were game design/development, generative art, and application development. I like the ideas of these paths because you have an option or safety to work in a company but also work for yourself. So I would like to dabble and improve my skills in those sectors. But I am also very excited for website development. I’ve always wanted to create my own personal portfolio. 

With hearing the new technologies that are coming forth each and every day I am excited for what the future holds. I feel that currently I am in a loop of trying to develop my life to be ready for the next coming transformative years. While it may be very hard right now it won’t always be eventually you will learn to break out of the loop.
```
while(true){
break; // When the break statement is used in a loop, it breaks the loop and continues executing the code after the loop (if any). 
}
```
